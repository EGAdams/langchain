    <h1>CodeGenAgent Roadmap</h1>
    <p>This document outlines our plan for refactoring and improving the existing CodeGenAgent. Each step is explained in detail and accompanied by a relatable analogy.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Understand the Existing Code</h2>
    <p>Before we start refactoring, we need to understand the existing CodeGenAgent and the tools it uses. This involves reviewing the Python files provided and understanding how they contribute to the overall functionality of the CodeGenAgent.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like studying the blueprint of an existing house before we start renovating it. We need to understand the structure and layout of the house, and how each room is used.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Define the Tools</h2>
    <p>Next, we need to refine the tools that our CodeGenAgent will use. These could be operations like "generate class definition", "generate function definition", "generate variable declaration", etc. Each tool should be able to take an input and produce an output that is a piece of C++ code. We also need to ensure that our tools are flexible enough to support future requirements, such as generating Python code.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like deciding what tools our renovation team will use to remodel the house. We might need a hammer, a saw, a drill, and so on.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 3: Refactor the CodeGenAgent</h2>
    <p>Once we have refined our tools, we can start refactoring the CodeGenAgent. This involves improving the existing code to make it more efficient, readable, and maintainable, while ensuring that it still meets the original requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like starting the renovation process. We might need to tear down some walls, build new ones, or repaint the rooms to make the house better suited to our needs.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 4: Use the CodeGenAgent to Generate Code</h2>
    <p>With our refactored CodeGenAgent, we can start generating C++ code. This involves using the methods of the CodeGenAgent class to manage the code generation process, including generating .h and .cpp files for the object and unit tests, modifying the Makefile, running final tests, and debugging if necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like using our renovated house. We can start living in it, using the rooms for their intended purposes, and making adjustments as needed.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 5: Review and Refine</h2>
    <p>As we use our CodeGenAgent to generate code, we will likely find areas where we can improve. We might need to add new tools, refine our existing tools, or change the way our CodeGenAgent makes decisions. This is an ongoing process of review and refinement.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like living in our renovated house and making changes as needed. We might decide to add a window here, move a door there, or change the layout of a room.</p>
