    <h1>CodeGenAgent Roadmap</h1>
    <p>This document outlines our plan for constructing our own CodeGenAgent. Each step is explained in detail and accompanied by a relatable analogy.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Understand the Problem</h2>
    <p>Before we start coding, we need to understand what we want our CodeGenAgent to do. This involves defining the high-level requirements of our C++ project and understanding how a CodeGenAgent can help us meet those requirements. We will also need to identify the specific tasks that the CodeGenAgent will need to perform, such as creating directories, generating code files, and executing shell commands.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like deciding what kind of house we want to build. We need to know how many rooms we want, what style of house we like, and so on.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Define the Tools</h2>
    <p>Next, we need to define the tools that our CodeGenAgent will use. These could be operations like "generate class definition", "generate function definition", "generate variable declaration", etc. Each tool should be able to take an input and produce an output that is a piece of C++ code. We will also need to define tools for creating directories and executing shell commands.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like deciding what tools our construction manager will use to build the house. We might need a hammer, a saw, a drill, and so on.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 3: Design the CodeGenAgent Class</h2>
    <p>Once we have defined our tools, we can start designing the CodeGenAgent class. This involves deciding what properties and methods the class will have, and how it will interact with the tools. We will need to consider principles of object-oriented design and the SOLID principles to ensure that our class is well-designed and easy to maintain.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like creating the blueprints for our house. We need to decide where each room will go, how the rooms will be connected, and so on.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Implement the CodeGenAgent Class</h2>
    <p>With our design in place, we can start implementing the CodeGenAgent class. This involves writing the Python code for the class and its methods, and testing it to ensure that it works correctly. We will need to pay close attention to the details of the implementation to ensure that it meets our requirements and follows our design.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like building the house according to the blueprints. We need to make sure that each room is the right size, that the walls are straight, and so on.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Instantiate the CodegenAgent</h2>
    <p>Once we have implemented the CodegenAgent class, we can instantiate it with our tools. This involves creating a new instance of the CodegenAgent class and passing in our tools as arguments.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like hiring our construction managerI apologize for the incomplete response. Here's the continuation:

    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like hiring our construction manager and giving them access to the tools they will need to build the house.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 6: Use the CodeGenAgent to Generate Code</h2>
    <p>Finally, we can use the methods of the CodeGenAgent class to manage the code generation process. This involves calling the `aplan` method to decide what operation to perform next, the `arun_tool` method to execute the operation, and the `atake_next_step` method to manage the overall process. We will also need to ensure that the CodeGenAgent can handle errors and exceptions gracefully, and that it can log its actions for debugging purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like letting our construction manager get to work. They decide what needs to be done next, instruct the workers to do it, and check that the work has been done correctly.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 7: Review and Refine</h2>
    <p>As we use our CodeGenAgent to generate code, we will likely find areas where we can improve. We might need to add new tools, refine our existing tools, or change the way our CodeGenAgent makes decisions. This is an ongoing process of review and refinement. We will also need to ensure that our CodeGenAgent is well-documented, so that other developers can understand how it works and how to use it.</p>
    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like reviewing the progress of our house construction and making changes as needed. We might decide to add a window here, move a door there, or change the layout of a room.</p>
